Mopik Automation is a consulting-style portfolio targeted at e-commerce brands and streamers who want to automate promotional workflows and reduce manual marketing tasks.

## Primary Call to Action (CTA)
**Claim Your AI Readiness Score**  
Secondary CTA: **Get a Free Automation Audit**

## Orchestration Log (AI Error + Fix)
The AI initially recommended a heavier framework setup that would slow deployment and complicate GitHub Pages hosting. I corrected this by pivoting to a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS structure to ship faster and keep the repo simple.

## Repo Checklist (for grading)
- `README.md` — human-facing overview + live link
- `AGENTS.md` — master orchestration letter (source of truth for the build)
- `index.html` + `/css` + `/js` — website codebase
- `/assets` — images/screenshots for case studies
